This march was quite interesting. A lot of educational lows and hights packed into a single month. On the upside, March is over, I finished two books, and April is the last month of the school semester.

## What am I reading



### How To Win Friends & Influence People

<IMG url="/lincoln.png"/>

When March initially set out I declared I'd be reading ***How  To Win Friends & Influence People***. I've only heard praise for the book, so my expectations were high. And I can safely say, the book lived up to the hype. For those that haven't read it yet, the book is a collection of mini stories, some about ordinary people and others about significant figures like, Abraham Lincoln.

While reading I always found myself wondering how the said individual managed to escape the issue at hand in the majority of the stories. For as many stories as there are (around 2-3 per page) they all feel oddly unique, even though many of them are intended to teach a similar lesson.

Throughout the read I caught on to many of the techniques and started to remember times in my life where either someone used these tactics on me, or I subconsciously used one of the tricks on someone else.

As I finished the stories I start mental simulations to see if this method would prove to be effective against myself. Eventually I came to learn that there truly affective ways of getting someone to do something for you on a consistence basis

**Some key takeaways for me:**

- Even the greats bled and made mistakes.
- When angry don't react on instinct, give the situation some time and come back later.
- The most successful people are able to influence on a large scale because they understand people.
- The greatest step to influencing anyone is to understand everyone
- Become genuinely interested in everyone

### The Lean Startup

After buying this book freshmen year (2018) I decided to finally read it. When reading this book freshman year, I finished around 30% of the book, but the content felt hard and dense (which led me to drop). However, this time around it feels like I read book version of [How I Built This with Guy Raz](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this). Similar to *How To Win Friends & Influence People* is split into short/small stories and explanations, this book does the same. Anyhow, this time around the story is cenetered around author, *Eric Ries*, and his findings in running a startup.

Investigating, both, big and small companies Ries does an incredible job explaining how companies of any size can innovate and scale. As well as, the things each should be focused on.

**Some key takeaways for me:**


- The term "startup" isn't exclusive to technology based companies
- Startups often fail because they don't pay attention and steal what successful companies already do well.
- Even if you believe you have thorough research there's still a good chance the product won't succeed.
- Customer feedback isn't a statistic you should solely rely on to determine if a product is experiencing success or growth.
- Constant innovation is the key
- It's okay to not have a working product initially, in fact it might be better that it's not polished in some cases.
- Don't double down market prediction and lose sight of everything else. Pivots have played an important part of many modern companies  Always be on the lookout for growth opportunities.
- You probably don't understand your customers wants
- Great products weren't always great
- If you're not failing, you're not learning (to an extent)

### Bought More Books
<IMG url="/books.jpg"/>

My onhand book collection was dwendling down and I'd been looking forward to more books...so I did the obvious thing and ordered some more.

1. **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind** â€“ Yuval Harari
2. **Dune** â€“ Frank Herbert
3. **Steve Jobs** â€“ Walter Issacson
4. **Solving Product Design Exercises** â€“ Artiom Dashinsky

With the movie adaption coming out in October (if not delayed) later this year, I'm going to be reading *Dune* as my next book. Because this book is quite a bit bigger than past books, I'm going to settle on finishing one book this month.
## What am I watching

Earlier in March Netflix announced the third season of ***Formula 1: Drive to Survive,*** set to release on March 16th. After caving and binge watching the first two seasons in September of last year, I've since become extremely invested into the sport.

The more I watch the more I think about how entertaining the sport really is. Netflix does an incredible job of painting storylines for the individual teams, as well as, the drivers. By the end of the first season I'd already formed my favorites (both drivers and teams), and I understood the excitement behind the sport.


It feels like you're just watching startups compete week to week. With races each week for around 8-9 months. Teams try to engineer and refine their cars in hopes of improvements the following week. Netflix interviews just about every major character in the sport so you get insight into how they perceive each other. Creating a drama-fueld competitive sport.

As someone who had little to no knowledge on racing prior to watching the show, going in I had the question of, ***how do drivers distinguish themselves if the fastest car is going to win?***.  With the common system of two drivers per team, the answer becomes quite apparent. When drivers on the same team are given the exact same car, you quickly see the different styles and the way each of them wield it.

With the added element of competition among teams, within lies a layer competition among the internal drivers and makes for quite a unique atmosphere that isn't possible in many other sports. Drivers are both racing to help team standings, while also trying to outperform their teammate to ensure they aren't the ones getting replaced.

## Life

### Work
<IMG url="/wind-rises.gif"/>

Earlier last month I detailed that I'd started a new job as a junior developer.

I've had the oppurtunity of developing endpoints for a public API which is something I'd previously wanted to learn/improve at.

Over the past few weeks I've seen drastic changes in how I think about every single line. Most of my previous knowledge was self-taught and me working in isolation. However, now that I'm working in a team environment, I've noticed how my small habits can affect others. For instance, if I'm working on a side project or even this website for example, I sometimes find myself using random variable names as ***Im the only one that going to read this code***. After getting accustomed to code reviews, I've started to quite enjoy them, as I'm always finding ways to improve.

As someone that previously suffered with asking for help in the past, but now somewhat the opposite. I've been riding the fine line of managing how much time to spend working on something before asking for help.

### School
In my [Early March Update](/blog/early-march-update) post I stated, *"I'm not sure how smart it was to just inject something that'll consume a lot of my time while simultaneously going through the hardest semester of my undergrad"* ðŸ¤¡. Quite honestly it's going exactly as I'd predicted. While my grades and studies have taken a noticeable hit past month, I've made it work thanks to my understanding school group mates and friends. 

My motivation for school has been thinning (was already thin) since midway of last semester. And it's just gradually gotten worst. While I could've hoped to retain high grades in all my classes. I'm just glad im passing and it looks like I'll have a smooth transition into summer break and the following fall semester.

**Note**: Sorry if there's grammar mistakes :( I wrote this at different points throughout the past month. Next time I'll find a way to improve it. 

Thanks for reading :D
