As I've progressed into my young adult life I've started redefine the methods that allow me to learn new topics at a rate that I deem comfortable.

<!-- ## Through the years -->

### Throughout the Years

Throughout elementary school and junior high when learning new things, I always attacked things head on and dove right in with no prior knowledge. If I had an idea I'd just start the project and learn about the topic as I'm creating. This was mostly because I didn't like learning in a linear structured process, but enjoy learning only about the bits that interest me. Allowing me to pave my own curriculum. For instance, during this period of time (age 10-14) I was interested in graphic design. Because I was still a kid and didn't have access to the tools to properlly learn the trade in a structure, I'd just YouTube Photoshop effects I thought were cool and learn them.

Approaching any hobby this way allowed me to stay engaged for an extremely long time. In addition, it relieves the burdern of having to learn EVERYTHING about a topic before starting. However, the downside in my experience to this way of learning is that it creates gaps in my knowledge. While I was profecient and replicating and mocking up designs, I designed without purpose or meaning. In addition, I lacked the knowledge base and vocabulary of someone that took the time to learn the background of the subject. This alone made me hit a brickwall and I felt as if I couldn't progress much further unless I learned the basics.

While diving in is a great way to initially learn at an exponential rate, line will eventually flatten if you don't have a solid foundation of the topic.

**Side Note**: As I'm writing this, this topic seems to be in the same scope as the split opinions on bootcamps for work fields and college degree vs no-degree

### Now
Currently when picking up new topics I do a hybrid. Above I mentioned the *dive-in method*, which I still believe to be a token in the way I learn. However, now I encorporate **reading & social media**.

While reading seems self explantory, it's important to research and find the best resources to learn. This can make our break your enjoyment when learning anything new.


Social media is one of the greatest learning tools that many have access to. Whichever way you look at it, social media enables activity between users and people from every sector of the world.

If I'm going to spend a good amount of time on social media, why not do something productive? Some people believe submerging yourself in the culture and region that a language comes from to be the fastest way to learning a new language. The same can be said about subjects/topics, but with media communities. 

At this point in time virtually every community / field is in some way shape or form on social media. By following people you believe to be leaders or good teachers within the niche you're learning you can gain direct insights and thoughts (expiditing the learning process) of them by following on platforms like *Twitter*.


**Example** : When developing this website I had goals of using Next.js and some other technologies so I found good documentation allowing me to learn the correct way. I then followed the developers and community heads on *Twitter* to learn on the fly aswell.

**[THE END]**
