- Code
- Design
- esports
    - CS:GO
    - League of Legends
    - Call of Duty
    - StarCraft
- sports
    - Basketball
    - Football
    - Formula 1 (new!)
- TV Shows/Movies
- Social Media
- Startups
- Music
- College


### Goals For Website
- Share thoughts on random topics
    - Write more
- Improve the archicture and flow. <A text="Source" link="https://github.com/Haustle/www"/>
