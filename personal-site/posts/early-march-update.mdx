I want to start doing monthly or quarterly updates on what I've been up to. I'm not quite sure on the format in which I'm going to present this, but I wanted to share.

## Reading

This year I'm making an effort to actively read. Although I always windup reading 1-4 books a year on any given year, this year I wanted to make it a challenge. So for my new years' resolution I decided to read at least 1 book a month. Down below are the books I've read up to this point

- Jan : **The Hobbit**
- Feb : **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep**

Although so far the two books I've read haven't been my cup of tea per-say I'm proud of myself for at least finishing them. In addition, I've been reading the books last minute (I'm a procrastinator), which may play a factor in terms of my enjoyment of the material.

**Note:** I'm not going to write a review on *The Hobbit* as most people know the concept of the story


### Short Review : Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep

<IMG url="/b2049.png" caption="Scene from Blade Runner 2049 (film)" width="600px"/>

This book starts off extremely odd and some may honestly be a turn off for some. However once I powered through the initial pages of the book I was already quite hooked. All it took was a simple morning routine. In the opening scene the main character, Rick Deckard, wakes up alongside his wife when an argument starts up immediatly on the topic of, what channel(s) should they dial into for their mental well being for the day. You quickly learn these channels(?) are code name for emotion types.

Just by reading a short snippet, I was engaged as to how the world spiraled to the point where married couples are fighting over what emotions each other should be feeling throughoutt he day

With a major over arching emphasis on interaction with technology the author does an incredible job of bending the questions of what makes something real, and where do you define the line of consciousness, and what seperates man from everything else.

The book, written in 1968 does a pretty good job of predicting the types of issues and problems that may arise in the future when there's a politically driven world. Although the book is quite short (little over 200 pages) and doesn't elaborate in some places you wish it had, it leaves a lot on the table to ponder about. It feels almost as if you're just reading about a mental model (a way of thinking), which was something I didn't expect when starting this novel. Playing major roles in inspiration for films, *Blade Runner* and *Blade Runner 2049* I highly suggest watching the movies if you're interested in the topic as they do an incredible job of brining the visuals from book to movie screen.

### Reading conclusion......and Next

This month I've decided to settle on *How To Win Friends & Influence People*. Unlike the previous months, I've already started reading and gotten through a good amount already. Meaning this might be the first month where I finish 2 books, which would be exciting. Almost feels therapeutic to just ignore everything and drift to a different setting for a little bit. Hopefully I'll be writing about **atleast** one book next month.

## Website Progression

### Markdown to Blog

I've recently completed development on a process that'll squash the time it takes from finishing writing to actually deploying the posts. Previously I'd have to write and then go and hard code features or styling I'd like the post to have


However, now I have the current workflow of **Writing in Notion ‚Üí Exporting Markdown File ‚Üí Dropping it a folder** and website handles the rest. This is a step in the right direction of striving to make the website as inputless as possible while maintaining speed.. 

With the help of [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) (and [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter))  and scavaging through the personal website repositories of [Paco](https://github.com/pacocoursey/paco) and [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) I was able to find something that worked for me.

**Continuation:** Although there are already many posts and tutorials explanining the process, I think i'll write an extended version of the process I've described above.

### Future and Immediate Next steps

It's hard to find time to work on projects, but here are the next immediate plans I have for this website.
- Work on optimizing image load times in the blog posts
- Start experimenting with a work / projects page
- Find a platform and API to use for `/bookmarks`

**Note:** I've been waiting on the Notion API to complete the `/bookmarks` flow, however I might have to explore other options.

### New Job
I've recently found a job as a **junior developer**. I'm not sure how smart it was to just inject something that'll consume a lot of my time while simultaneously going through the hardest semester of my undergrad. However though, the work I'll be doing is quite cool, so atleast that's exciting.

### School
School has started to become draining and the elimination of afall and spring break drive the nail down even farther. I constantly find myself dreading about assignments, projects, and exams. 

As most of the courses I'm taking are now upper level, it's insane to see the difficulty in assignments change in one semester. As well as the overall difficulty of the material.

I can't wait for summer break üôè

### Projects
I haven't had the time to really work or think about projects in the past month, which is something I usually look forward to, to stay busy and excited.
