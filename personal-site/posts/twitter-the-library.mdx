### How I use Twitter

For the most part I don't interact publically with anyone on Twitter or really any platform as I never see it as a positive thing long term. So, instead I just use it as a news / learning (library) feed for communities I'm interested in. Although I've used it this way for quite some time now, this year I started to see myself develop and improve more in areas I seeked growth before. 

I think by surrounding your feed with people you feel are brilliant and share content you think is interesting (don't need to have any understanding of the topic, but just a willingness to read and learn) you'll slowly start gravitating towards things they talk about and eventually it becomes the new norm for you and then you can slowly dive down rabbit holes and learn at good rates.

For instance, I follow many developers / designers that tweet , and in my eyes, they're communicating in foreign languages. Dicussing concepts and ideas I cant wrap my head around as an amateur, but they felt it was important and decided to tweet about it. 

### Unrealistic Standards

Want to talk about <A link="https://sahilbloom.substack.com/p/the-dunning-kruger-effect" text="Dunning Kruger Effect"/>

In a way this topic ties into the toxic form of social media, where people only display the best parts about themselves so you slowly thinking everything on their feed is a clear representation. And you slowly generate a fictional plane on how you should be living life. And start believing that is the norm. So you follow or see someone who's extremely fit, so you think *"Damn I need to get to a gym"*. Sure, you might not commit and go as consistently as you'd like, but in the end, a bundle posts manipulated you into trying something.`



However, if you surround yourself with people who're just sharing knowledge the idea kind of works the same way.  "Wow this dude is always developing...Wow this dude is always reading and posting good content...". Sure you might not reach the point you hope for but you atleast tried . And skill and performance are both relative. I'm sure those same people you admire, also admire others and have at one point or another felt the same way. Everyone has a source of motivation / inspiration and it's the reason they do what they do.

As long as you can drop your ego and remain as someone who's actively seeking and working towards a goal

### Putting a face to the product

Twitter as a platform is as personal (and information dense) as it gets when it comes to media platforms. With the ability to share a paragraph, a video, an image, an article or prrety much any media type for that matter. Your profile can act almost as both a résumé and a scrapbook. So just by scrolling through someone's profile I can somewhat get an idea of what types of mediums drive them.

When I come across musicians (musicians) that I adore, I scour for all interviews and any information that impacts their creation process. By doing this it makes the music a little more grabbing and touching a second time through.

I think for me the same process applies to internet communities. If there are products or tools that I use or interest me I think it's cool to read into the thoughts behind design and product decisions. Fortunate enough many people within the communities I follow don't mind sharing information they feel will help others. Further more after acknowledging this information it makes every interaction with a product that someone I follow had an impact on that much more insightful. For example, whether it be a designer (that I admire) sharing an article on their recent work, what books they're reading, podcasts that effected the way they work, change in their morning routine, or a change in the way they attack work, etc. . If you aspire to have some tools that another person has, why not steal the resources they have to share and offer?

### How I follow

You're a product of your environment and I think the most powerful tool is the following list that every single individual on the platform has. If i think an individual distributes great content, I'll just check to see who they follow and scan through additional profiles. **Essentially a recursive act that I spend too much time doing**. By another user using having a follow from someone you follow, it's essentially a digital co-sign, which is where the power comes into affect. For instance, if I find out two people who I followed for completely different reasons share a follow on an individual it probably means this person could be a blend of the two (which in theory should be a good follow for you). In past times you have may have needed to ask to be introduced to an individual to learn more about them, but now you're just a twitter and a follow away.

Above I mentioned "You're a product of your environment", which in this case can be a double edged sword if not utilized correctly. As you're following people you may start seeing the same patterns and same opinions, so I think it's equally important to critically choose those you follow and and always question if you should remain following them, because in the end these you will be consciously / subconsciously consuming the content. As these are the people that'll be coming across my feed everyday, I try to imagine my following list like a starting line up and will interchange them  as need be. 

### Conclusion

**From afar** **I think social media is best looked at as a library with a rotating guest speaker. And is my favorite tool when learning new things.**

This is my first article and is kind of all over th eplace. If you have criticism please message / email me :)
