Woohooooo...this dreadful semester has come to an end and summer is here ([Ready for summer](https://open.spotify.com/track/3uwDoSjDd5HoLZgEFgxPEF?si=a5a163788d2f45f5)).

# i. Reading

I caved in and started using my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/haustle) account (forgot I had an account). It's an easy way to make reading fun and what better way than to reward myself with a shiny star after a book completion ⭐️

### Dune by Frank Herbert ( Done )

<IMG url="/dune.png" caption="Shared image from the set of `Dune`" width="600px"/>


Since the movie [stills](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/04/behold-dune-an-exclusive-look-at-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-oscar-isaac) were teased ahead of the trailer releasing I became more fascinated with the architecture of the world. This drove me to become fascinate with the name, due to amount of time I thought about the pictures. Side note, the name feels very dense and menacing and fits like a glove in association with the book. Because I'm a sucker for dystopian world building I had to read the book ahead of the movie release (October 2021). With many people regarding the book and series as some of the best science fiction ever written, I had a lot of hopes going into the first book to say the least.

I mentioned in my previous post I haven't read many articles of work in the science fiction genre, so I'm not really sure what to base my experiences off of. Starting the book you're thrown into a scene (a cliché one), where some whispering adults are discussing whether or not Paul is the chosen one.

What I enjoy about Paul as a MC, is how straightforward he is. He knows what he is and what he is not. With most epics encapsulating a hero, there's usually some battle arc to give the reader/watcher a guage as to how the MC stacks up against other characters. Dune takes a different approach. Although he's a strong character by combat means, his true strengths shine when he needs to lead others. Watching Paul and other characters break down and analyze situations gives you a tiny glimpse into how brilliant and wonderfully organized each character is and the grand potential of the world. Typically most stories come down to a punch of whether the main character can complete the dance and obliterate the enemy. While there are direct antagonists and a story line to be completed, I lost complete sight of this and simply grew to love the settings and the individuals that are present throughout the story. The protagonist has been paired with an equally bright and well-crafted enemy, so you quickly learn there will be no clear victories. Multiple times throughout the book I found myself appalled by the cleverness and studiousness displayed on both sides.

Herbert has wonderfully crafted a relatable fully fleshed out fictional world. He's molded systems for social, religion, philosophy, education, science/engineering, politics, military and so much more. When you think there's a major plot hole → you learn it doesn't exist and Herbert is 5 steps ahead.

It truly blows my mind this book was originally released in 1965, which goes to show the strength of Herberts writing as it has aged wonderfully and could easily be mistaken for something written recent.

Prior to reading I wouldn't think I could escape a fiction book with knowledge suitable for the real world or at the least something I could passively think about consistently. This book shattered that myth.

I'm not sure when I'll get the chance to finish the series, but when I do, I'll for sure want to binge the rest.

### Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari ( 48% Done )

<IMG url="/huntergather.png"  width="400px" shadow={false}/>


I don't want to into too much detail about the book, but **this is a must read for all**. 

Living day to day, it can become increasingly difficult to conceptualize that we live in the same world as the people and events that you learn about in history class. Harari does an incredible job of grounding the reader and deconstructing the events humans faced earlier on in time, and relating it back to modern day human activity

With many heavy hitting concepts, ideas, and theories, this will for sure be a consistent re-read in the near future.

While only being midway through, I can tell this one will resonate with me for a very very long time.

# ii. School

The leap in difficulty from sophomore to junior year is not to be underestimated. Knowing basic programming doesn't really cut it, as the majority of the content assumes you already have fundamentals down. And ventures off into topics like compilers, parsers, operating systems, etc. . Which are topics I was looking forward to taking a deep dive into, but due to online schooling my passion for those topics drifted away quickly and I transitioned into a do the minimum to pass mindset. While I left with a decent understanding on the topics I really wish I got the chance to truly enjoy these classes.

However though, shoutout to all my friends and students on the discord channels who helped me along this semester.  As well as, the professors for being more than accommodating, whether it be moving dates, curving tests, or more office hours .

### Assignments / Projects

> "You can't finish the assignment in a couple of days"

The term above is tossed around by professors and usually you can take it with a grain of salt as lots of people. However, this semester the projects really couldn't be completed in 1-2 day span. Even with a 5-7 day stretch I was quite nervous. As lackadaisical as I've been this year, these large projects really whipped me into shape and helped me learn a ton. My C++ skills have gotten infinitely better after debugging for hours.

Most projects were written with little information in order to drive students to learn more via google and documentation reading. Which honestly was pretty nice, as we were then allowed to structure our projects and code as we wanted.

I think the lowest point project of this semester was mid way through and I had maybe about 1/4th of a project completed and my internet was extremely inconsistent 2 days in a row. I went to campus to work on it only to find out all libraries were closed early, and all other student facilites closed soon after. Good thing there's still campus WiFi, so I just worked outside at a random table...and then it started raining. I found a faculty facility where I just sat in the lobby working for an additional 3-5 hours only to not figure out a bug that'd been holding me back. I ended up getting around a 20% on the project and I thought it was the end of me. After spending over 7 on campus and not getting a decent grade, it was a good wakeup call and caused me to plan better the rest of the semester. In the end I winded up bouncing back and managed to pass.

### Discord

Discord environment for school is something I'm truly going to miss as it was the best out-of-class collaborating I've ever experienced for school. It feels like a specified stack overflow and google geared towards your classes. I think the thing discord did better than other services the school tried to incorporate, was anonymity.

Some pros:

- If you run into an issue on a project, more than likely someone else ran into it, and you search specific channels with keywords to find a solution.
- You feel as though every assignment is a huge group project because everyone is working on it at the same time and asking questions.
- No fear of asking dumb questions, because there's no punishment, no one knows who you are.
- Removed the need to directly reach out to professors as much
- Inspiring seeing everyone work on the project at the same time
- Feel the need to give back and help other students after receiving help, thus creating a cycle.

### Finals

To keep it short, it was more stressful then it needed to be. I almost got zeros for two finals, due to writing down the end time as the start time, and my laptop dying mid test. However, all ended well and everything is okay.

### Onward

It's crazy to say I officially made it to senior year.

# iii. Side Projects

I haven't had too much time to code non-school and non-work material throughout most of the semester, so after school finished I had the chance to work on some stuff.

### Meta data

<IMG url="/twitter-meta-card-white.png" caption="How links to my blog posts via Twitter look now" width="400px" shadow={false}/>


I've been wanting to add meta data to the website, because I like the look of embeded cards on Twitter and just for better SEO and scraping for crawlers. There are quite a few nuances I didn't know about. For instance, depending on the platform you post on, you may need to add different/more meta tags. Spending a little over a day on this led me down a rabbithole where I learned about the importance that meta data plays in SEO.

The only cards that are working (currently) are recent blog posts. However over the next month I should be able to update and roll this out to all other pages.

### Shopify Challenge

<IMG url="/shopify-challenge-screenshot.png" caption="Screenshot of user libaray after they've selected 5 movies" width="600px"/>

### Upcoming

[Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started) entered public beta today, so I can finally finish my `/bookmarks` page and have the respected lists auto-update. As I have been slacking when it comes to manually updating.

# iv. Microsoft

I've accepted an internship at Microsoft for this upcoming summer, so hopefully I can discuss and share my journey throughout summer 🤞
